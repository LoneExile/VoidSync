# VoidSync (ðŸš§ WIP)

VoidSync is an application that synchronizes files with MinIO.

## Background

I wanted to learn the Go programming language, and that's how this project came
to life. My primary goal was to create a file synchronization application for my
note-taking app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

I have been using Obsidian along with [Rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone)
to synchronize my notes. However, rclone doesnâ€™t have real-time sync
functionality. My goal is to implement real-time synchronization not only for my
note-taking app but also for other applications and use cases I might encounter
in the future.

Along the way, I wanted to gain experience working with Kafka and MinIO. Also,
this project will serve as the backend for my
[blog](https://github.com/LoneExile/blog), which is built with Astro. My hope is
to complete it eventually.
