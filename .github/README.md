# VoidSync (WIP)

VoidSync is an application that synchronizes files with MinIO and supports
notifications using Kafka.

## Background

I wanted to learn the Go programming language, and that's how this project came
to life. My primary goal was to create a file synchronization application for my
note-taking app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Along the way, I also
wanted to gain experience working with Kafka and MinIO. Eventually, this project
will serve as the backend for my [blog](https://github.com/LoneExile/blog),
which is built with Astro. My hope is to complete it eventually.
